# SHIELD v2 API

This document specifies the behavior of the SHIELD API, version 2,
in its entirety.  This is a specification, not merely
documentation &mdash; it is the authoritative source.  If this
document is unclear, it will be amended.  If the SHIELD codebase
disagrees with this specification, the code is incorrect and
should be treated as such.

The purpose of this document is to allow 3rd party integrators to
inter-operate with the SHIELD API without resorting to spelunking
through its implementation.

## Error Handling

The SHIELD API returns errors by using non-200 HTTP status codes,
as follows:

  - **500** - An internal error has occurred; details will be
    present in the SHIELD Core server error log.  The response
    will contain a sanitized error message, using the standard
    format (described below).

  - **400** - Something about the HTTP request was invalid or
    incorrect.  This may occur if a JSON payload was expected,
    but not provided, required keys in theat payload were missing,
    or values supplied were incorrect, out-of-range, etc.

  - **404** - The requested resource was not found.  An error
    (in the standard format) will be returned.

  - **401** - The requester is not authenticated to the SHIELD
    API, but has requested a protected endpoint.  The request
    may be retried after authenticating.

  - **403** - The requester is authenticated but has requested
    an endpoint that they do lack the rights to access.  This
    request should not be retried.

Regardless of the HTTP status code used, the SHIELD API will
always include a JSON payload with more details, in either the
**Standard Format** or the **Missing Values Format**.

### Standard Format for Error Reporting

The **Standard Format** for error reporting consists of a
top-level JSON object containing a single key, `error`, that
contains a human-readable error message, suitable for display.

Example:

```json
{
  "error": "No such retention policy"
}
```

This format is used for all non-validation error reporting.

### Missing Values Format for Error Reporting

The **Missing Values Format** for error reporting is used for
reporting request validation errors where required fields in the
request payload are missing.  It consists of a top-level JSON
object containing a single key, `missing`, which is set to a list
of field names that must be sent in the request, but were not.

Example:

```json
{
  "missing": [
    "name",
    "endpoint",
    "agent"
  ]
}
```

The order of the fields is inconsequential.
## Health & Informational

The health and informational endpoints give you a glimpse into the
well-being of a SHIELD Core, for monitoring purposes, at various
levels of detail.


### GET /v2/info

Returns minimal information necessary for forward-compatibility
with different versions of SHIELD Core and clients.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/info
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

```json
{
  "version" : "6.7.2",
  "env"     : "PRODUCTION",
  "api"     : 2
}
```

The `version` key only shows up if the request was made in the
context of an authenticated session.

The `env` key is configurable by the SHIELD site administrator,
at deployment / boot time.

The `api` key is a single integer that identifies which version
of the SHIELD API this core implements.  Currently, there are
two possible values:

  - **2** - The `/v2` endpoints are present, but not `/v1`
  - **1** - Only the `/v1` endpoints are present (legacy).

**Access Control**

This endpoint requires no authentication or authorization.

**Errors**

This API endpoint does not return any error conditions.

### GET /v2/health

Returns health information about the SHIELD Core, connected
storage accounts, and general metrics, at a global scope.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/health
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

If all goes well, you will receive a 200 OK, with a `Content-Type`
of `application/json`, and something similar to the following JSON
payload in the response body:

## SHIELD Authentication

The Authentication endpoints allow clients to authenticate to a
SHIELD Core, providing credentials to prove their identity and
their authorization to perform other tasks inside of SHIELD.


### POST /v2/auth/login

Authenticate against the SHIELD API as a local user, and retrieve
a session ID that can be used for future, authenticated,
interactions.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST https://shield.host/v2/auth/login \
     --data-binary '
{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}'
```

**NOTE:** `password` is sent in cleartext, so SHIELD should aways be
communicating over TLS (HTTPS).

Both fields, `username`, and `password`, are required.

**Response**

```json
{
  "ok": "95cca9ea-d2e6-4966-b071-9df6856a0e55"
}
```

The session ID (return under the `ok` key) should be passed on
subsequent requests as proof of authentication.  This can be done
by setting the `shield7` cookie to the session ID, or by setting
the `X-Shield-Session` request header.

**Access Control**

This endpoint requires no authentication or authorization.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Unable to log you in**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **Incorrect username or password**:
  The supplied credentials were incorrect; either the
  user doesn't exist, or the password was wrong.


### GET /v2/auth/logout

Destroy the current session and log the user out.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/auth/logout
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

```json
{
  "ok" : "Successfully logged out"
}
```

**NOTE:** The same behavior is exhibited when an authenticated
session successfully logs out, as is seen when an unauthenticated
session attempts to log out.

**Access Control**

This endpoint requires no authentication or authorization.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Unable to log you out**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators


### GET /v2/auth/id

Retrieve identity and authorization information about the
currently authenticated session.  If the requester has not
authenticated, a suitable response will be returned.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/auth/id
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name"    : "Your Full Name",
    "account" : "username",
    "backend" : "SHIELD",
    "sysrole" : ""
  },
  "tenants": [
    {
      "uuid": "63a8f402-31e6-4503-8fab-66cbcf411ed3",
      "name": "Some Random Tenant",
      "role": "admin"
    },
    {
      "uuid": "860f7685-c311-4ae5-b34d-6991fc721a37",
      "name": "Another Tenant",
      "role": "engineer"
    }
  ],
  "tenant": {
    "uuid": "63a8f402-31e6-4503-8fab-66cbcf411ed3",
    "name": "Some Random Tenant",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

The top-level `user` key contains information about the current
authenticated user, including their name and what authentication
provider they came from.

The `tenants` key lists _all_ of the tenants that this user
belongs to, along with the role assigned on each.  The session is
free to switch between any of these tenants as they see fit.

The `tenant` key contains the tenant definition for the currently
selected tenant, based on user preferences.

**Access Control**

This endpoint requires no authentication or authorization.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Authentication failed**:
  The request either lacked a session cookie (or an
  `X-Shield-Session` header), or some other internal
  error has occurred, and SHIELD administrators should
  investigate.


### GET /v2/auth/providers

Retrieve public configuration of SHIELD Authentication Providers,
which can be used by client systems to initiate authentication
against 3rd party systems like Github and Cloud Foundry UAA.


**Request**

    "provider" : "specific"
  }
}
```

**Access Control**

You must be authenticated to access this API endpoint.

You must also have the `admin` system role.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **No such authentication provider**:
  No authentication provider was found with the given
  identifier.

- **Authorization required**:
  The request was made without an authenticated session or auth token.
  See **Authentication** for more details.  The request may be retried
  after authentication.

- **Access denied**:
  The requester lacks sufficient tenant or system role assignment.
  Refer to the **Access Control** subsection, above.
  The request should not be retried.


### GET /v2/auth/tokens

Retrieve a list of all authentication tokens that have been
generated for use on behalf of the currently authenticated
user.  For security reasons, the session ID attached to the
authentication token is not returned.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/auth/tokens
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "uuid"       : "bbcb6675-8ec4-4412-93e3-35626860b126",
    "name"       : "test",
    "created_at" : "2017-10-21 00:54:33",
    "last_seen"  : null
  }
]
```

The `uuid` key is used strictly for retrieving and revoking each
authentication token; it cannot be used as an authentication token,
as it is not the session ID.

**Access Control**

You must be authenticated to access this API endpoint.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Authentication failed**:
  The request either lacked a session cookie (or an
  `X-Shield-Session` header), or some other internal
  error has occurred, and SHIELD administrators should
  investigate.

- **Unable to retrieve tokens information**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **Authorization required**:
  The request was made without an authenticated session or auth token.
  See **Authentication** for more details.  The request may be retried
  after authentication.


### POST /v2/auth/tokens

currently authenticated user.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST https://shield.host/v2/auth/tokens \
     --data-binary '
{
  "name": "auth-token-name"
}'
```

Each authentication token requires a name that is unique
to the parent user account.

**Response**

```json
{
  "uuid"       : "bbcb6675-8ec4-4412-93e3-35626860b126",
  "session"    : "8ef409e9-690d-4d91-9f74-6d657f56843e",
  "name"       : "test",
  "created_at" : "2017-10-21 00:54:33",
  "last_seen"  : null
}
```

The `uuid` key is used strictly for retrieving and revoking each
authentication token; it cannot be used as an authentication token,
as it is not the session ID.

The `session` key should be used 

**Access Control**

You must be authenticated to access this API endpoint.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Authentication failed**:
  The request either lacked a session cookie (or an
  `X-Shield-Session` header), or some other internal
  error has occurred, and SHIELD administrators should
  investigate.

     -X DELETE https://shield.host/v2/auth/tokens/:uuid \
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

```json
{
  "ok": "Token revoked"
}
```

Note that if you have revoked the auth token you were using, all
subsequent requests will fail to authenticated.  It makes sense,
but it bears repeating.

**Access Control**

You must be authenticated to access this API endpoint.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Unable to revoke auth token**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **Authorization required**:

## SHIELD Users

SHIELD provides both a local user database, and the ability to
map 3rd party systems into the SHIELD tenancy model.  These API
endpoints allow you to manage the former, and query the results
of the latter.


### GET /v2/auth/local/users




**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/auth/local/users
```

- **?exact=(t|f)**
When filtering users, perform either exact field / value
matching (`exact=t`), or fuzzy search (`exact=f`, the
default)


- **?uuid=**
Only show the local user that matches the given UUID.
This is a FIXME - we probably need to remove this.


- **?account=...**
Only show local users whose account names (usernames)
match the given value.  Subject to the `exact=(t|f)` query
string parameter.


- **?sysrole=...**
Only show local users who have been assigned the given
system role.


- **?limit=N**
Limit the returned result set to the first _limit_ users
that match the other filtering rules.  A limit of `0` (the
default) denotes an unlimited search.




**Response**

```json

## SHIELD Agents

These endpoints expose information about registered SHIELD Agents.


### GET /v2/agents

Retrieves information about all registered SHIELD Agents.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/agents
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name"         : "prod/web/42",
      "uuid"         : "1869e296-4aac-4a17-848d-04f73f743326",
      "address"      : "127.0.0.1:5444",
      "version"      : "dev",
      "status"       : "ok",
      "hidden"       : false,
      "last_error"   : "",
      "last_seen_at" : "2017-10-11 18:54:00"
    }
  ],
  "problems": {
    "1869e296-4aac-4a17-848d-04f73f743326": [
      "This SHIELD agent is reporting ..."
    ]
  }
}
```

The top-level `agents` key is a list of object describing each registered agent:

- **name** - The name of the SHIELD Agent, as set by
  the local system administrator (which may not be the
  SHIELD site administrator).

- **uuid** - The internal UUID assigned to this agent by the SHIELD Core.

- **address** - The `host:port` of the agent, from the
  point-of-view of the SHIELD Core.

- **version** - The version of the remote SHIELD Agent's software.

- **status** - The health status of the remote SHIELD
  Agent, one of `ok` or `failing`.

- **hidden** - Whether or not this agent has been administratively hidden.

- **last\_error** - TBD

- **last\_seen\_at** - When the remote SHIELD Agent last
  made contact with the SHIELD Core to refresh its
  registration and its metadata.  Date is formatted
  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, in 24-hour notation.

The top-level `problems` key maps agent UUIDs to a list of errors detected
statically by the SHIELD Core software.  Each problem is represented as an
English-language description of the underlying issue.  SHIELD reports these
problems to assist site administrators who may be running heterogenous
versions of the SHIELD Core and SHIELD Agent software.  In these
environments, issues may arise due to version incompatibility.  Newer
versions of the SHIELD Core may also be able to inform administrators about
known deficiencies in older version of the SHIELD Agent and SHIELD plugins.

**NOTE:** `problems` are reported by the SHIELD Core; it is perfectly
acceptable for an agent to report itself as healthy, but for the SHIELD Core
to assert that a problem exists.

**Access Control**

You must be authenticated to access this API endpoint.

You must also have the `admin` system role.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Unable to retrieve agent information**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **Authorization required**:
  The request was made without an authenticated session or auth token.
  See **Authentication** for more details.  The request may be retried
  after authentication.

- **Access denied**:
  The requester lacks sufficient tenant or system role assignment.
  Refer to the **Access Control** subsection, above.
  The request should not be retried.


### POST /v2/agents

Initiate agent registration.  The client must supply a POST body
with the details of the agent being registered.

Once an agent has pre-registered, the SHIELD Core will schedule a
"pingback" task, connecting to the agent using its remote peer
address (from the registration HTTP conversation) and the given
port.  This pingback occurs via the SSH protocol, with an op type
of "ping".  The agent must respond with the same _name_ that it
sent in the registration.

This exchange allows the SHIELD to validate registration requests,
using a weak form of authentication.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST https://shield.host/v2/agents \
     --data-binary '
{
  "name" : "some-identifier",
  "port" : 5444
}'
```

Where:

- message: name is the name of the agent to display in
  the backend, and in log messages.  Usually, an FQDN
  or other unique host identifier is preferable here.
- message: port is the port number that the SHIELD
  agent is bound to.  The remote peer IP will be
  determined from the HTTP request's peer address.

**Response**

On success, you will receive a 200 OK, and the following response:

```json
{
  "ok" : "Pre-registered agent <name> at <host>:<port>"
}
```

**Access Control**

This endpoint requires no authentication or authorization.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **No \`name' provided with pre-registration request**:
  Your request was missing the required `name`
  argument.  Re-attempt with the `name` argument.

- **No \`port' provided with pre-registration request**:
  Your request was missing the required `port`
  argument.  Re-attempt with the `port` argument.

- **Unable to pre-register agent \<name\> at \<host\>:\<port\>**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **Unable to determine remote peer address from '\<peer\>'**:
  SHIELD was unable to parse the HTTP connection's
  peer address as a valid IP address.  This should be
  investigated by the site administrators, your local
  network administrator, and possibly the SHIELD
  development team.


### GET /v2/agents/:uuid

Retrieve extended information about a single SHIELD Agent, including its
plugin metadata (what plugins are present, what configuration they accept or
require, etc.)


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/agents/:uuid
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

```json

            "type"     : "string",
            "required" : true
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "problems": [
    "This SHIELD agent is reporting ..."
  ]
}
```

The top-level `agents` key contains the same agent
information that the `GET /v2/agents` endpoint
returns.  Similarly, the `problems` key contains the
list of issues the SHIELD Core detected, based on this
agent's configuration / version.

The `metadata` key is exclusive to this endpoint, and
contains all of the agent metadata.  Of particular
interest is the `plugins` key, which contains a map of
plugin metadata, keyed by the plugin name.  The format
of this metadata is documented in
[/docs/plugins.md](/docs/plugins.md).

### GET /v2/tenants/:tenant/agents/:uuid

Retrieve extended information about a single SHIELD Agent,
viewable by a given tenant.  This includes plugin metadata, but
not problem information (which is accessible via `GET /v2/agents`,
but only to SHIELD administrators).


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/tenants/:tenant/agents/:uuid
```

This endpoint takes no query string parameters.

**Response**

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "name"         : "prod/web/42",
    "uuid"         : "1869e296-4aac-4a17-848d-04f73f743326",
    "address"      : "127.0.0.1:5444",
    "version"      : "dev",
    "status"       : "ok",
    "hidden"       : false,
    "last_error"   : "",
    "last_seen_at" : "2017-10-11 18:54:00"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "name"    : "prod/web/42",
    "version" : "dev",
    "health"  : "ok",

    "plugins": {
      "fs": {
        "author"   : "Stark & Wayne",
        "features" : {
          "store"  : "yes",
          "target" : "no"
        },

        "fields": [

            "type"     : "string",
            "required" : true
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The top-level `agents` key contains the same agent
information that the `GET /v2/tenants/:tenant/agents` endpoint
returns.

The `metadata` key is exclusive to this endpoint, and
contains all of the agent metadata.  Of particular
interest is the `plugins` key, which contains a map of
plugin metadata, keyed by the plugin name.  The format
of this metadata is documented in
[/docs/plugins.md](/docs/plugins.md).

**Access Control**

You must be authenticated to access this API endpoint.

You must also have the `operator` role on the tenant.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Unable to retrieve agent information**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **No such agent**:
  The requested agent UUID was not found in the list
  of registered agents visible to this tenant.

- **Authorization required**:
  The request was made without an authenticated session or auth token.
  See **Authentication** for more details.  The request may be retried
  after authentication.

- **Access denied**:
  The requester lacks sufficient tenant or system role assignment.
  Refer to the **Access Control** subsection, above.
  The request should not be retried.


## SHIELD Tenants

Tenants serve to insulate groups of SHIELD users from one another,
providing them a virtual view of SHIELD resources.  Each tenant
has their own targets, stores, and retention policy definitions,
as well as their own job configurations.  Each tenants archives
and tasks are visible only to members of that tenant, pursuant to
their assigned roles.


### GET /v2/tenants

Retrieve the list of all tenants currently defined.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/tenants
```

- **?exact=(t|f)**
When filtering tenants, perform either exact field / value
matching (`exact=t`), or fuzzy search (`exact=f`, the
default)


- **?uuid=**
Only show the tenant that matches the given UUID.
This is a FIXME - we probably need to remove this.


- **?name=...**
Only show tenant whose name matches the given value.  
Subject to the `exact=(t|f)` query string parameter.


- **?limit=N**
Limit the returned result set to the first _limit_ users
that match the other filtering rules.  A limit of `0` (the
default) denotes an unlimited search.




**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "uuid": "f2ebbb9f-87f9-43e0-8515-dfce5d4d844c",
    "name": "A Tenant",

    "archive_count"  : 32,
    "storage_used"   : 140509184,
    "daily_increase" : 1520435
  },
  {
    "uuid": "4b6f6e2a-6ac6-443e-a910-aa412744165e",
    "name": "Some Other Tenant",

    "archive_count"  : 2,
    "storage_used"   : 268435456,
    "daily_increase" : 268435456
  }
]
```

For each tenant, SHIELD will also return a handful of tenant
metrics, including how many backup archives belong to the tenant
(`archive_count`), the total amount of cloud storage used, in
bytes (`storage_used`), and a linear-fit daily delta of storage
usage (`daily_increase`), also in bytes.

**Access Control**

You must be authenticated to access this API endpoint.

You must also have the `manager` system role.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Unable to retrieve tenants information**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **Authorization required**:
  The request was made without an authenticated session or auth token.
  See **Authentication** for more details.  The request may be retried
  after authentication.

- **Access denied**:
  The requester lacks sufficient tenant or system role assignment.
  Refer to the **Access Control** subsection, above.
  The request should not be retried.


### POST /v2/tenants

Create a new tenant.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST https://shield.host/v2/tenants \
     --data-binary '
{
  "name"  : "New Tenant Name",
  "users" : [
    {
      "uuid"    : "989b724b-bd3d-4799-bfbd-75b2fb5b41f3",
      "account" : "juser",
      "role"    : "engineer"
    },
    {
      "uuid"    : "96d24e33-8e57-4431-95fb-f18b9dfa319a",
      "account" : "jhunt",
      "role"    : "operator"
    }
  ]
}'
```

The `name` field is required.

The `users` list contains a list of initial tenant
role assignments.  The `account` key of each user
object is optional, but can assist site administrators
when troubleshooting assignment issues (since it will
be printed to the log) -- integrations are encouraged
to always send it.

The `role` field indicates what level of access to
grant each invitee, and must be one of:

  - **admin** - Full administrative control, including the ability to add
    and remove users from the tenant, and change role assignments.  Use with
    caution.

  - **engineer** - Full configuration control, including the ability to
    create, update, and delete targets, stores, and retention policies.

  - **operator** - Operational access for running ad hoc backup jobs,
    pausing and unpausing defined jobs, and performing restores.

**Response**

```json
{
  "name": "A New Tenant",
  "uuid": "52d20ef4-f154-431e-a5bb-bb3a200976bb",

  "archive_count"  : 0,

### PUT /v2/tenants/:tenant/targets/:uuid

Update an existing target on a tenant.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X PUT https://shield.host/v2/tenants/:tenant/targets/:uuid \

}'
```

You can specify as many or few of these fields as you want;
omitted fields will be left at their previous values.

Note: the `endpoint` key is currently a string of JSON, which
means that it contains lots of escape sequences.  Future versions
of the v2 API (prior to launch) may alter this to be the full
JSON, inline, for both readability and sanity's sake.

## SHIELD Stores

Storage systems are essential to any data protection efforts,
since the protected data must reside elsewhere, on another system
in order to be truly safe.  Stores provide definitions of external
storage system where backup archives will be kept.

**NOTE:** the API endpoints in this section deal exclusively with
tenant-scoped storage systems.  For information on the endpoints
for managing global storage solutions, see the section titled
**SHIELD Global Resources**.


### GET /v2/tenants/:tenant/stores

Retrieve all defined stores for a tenant.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/tenants/:tenant/stores
```

- **?exact=(t|f)**
When filtering stores, perform either exact field / value
matching (`exact=t`), or fuzzy search (`exact=f`, the
default)


- **?unused=(t|f)**
When filtering stores, skip those that are unused (true) or used (false)


- **?name=...**
Only show stores whose name matches the given value.  
Subject to the `exact=(t|f)` query string parameter.


- **?plugin=...**
Only show stores who are associated with the given plugin.
Subject to the `exact=(t|f)` query string parameter.


- **?limit=N**
Limit the returned result set to the first _limit_ users
that match the other filtering rules.  A limit of `0` (the
default) denotes an unlimited search.




**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "uuid"    : "925c83ad-22e6-4cdd-bf63-6dd6d09cd86f",
    "name"    : "Cloud Storage Name",
    "global"  : false,
    "summary" : "A longer description of the storage configuration",
    "agent"   : "127.0.0.1:5444",
    "plugin"  : "fs",
    "config"  : {

      "bsdtar"   : "bsdtar"
    },
    "threshold": 1073741824
  }
]
```

The values under `config` will depend entirely on what the
operator specified when they initially configured the storage
system.

**Access Control**

You must be authenticated to access this API endpoint.

You must also have the `operator` role on the tenant.

**Errors**

The following error messages can be returned:

- **Unable to retrieve storage systems information**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **Authorization required**:
  The request was made without an authenticated session or auth token.
  See **Authentication** for more details.  The request may be retried
  after authentication.

- **Access denied**:
  The requester lacks sufficient tenant or system role assignment.

## SHIELD Tasks

Tasks represent the context, status, and output of the execution of
some operation, be it a scheduled backup job being run, an ad hoc
restore operation, etc.

Since tasks represent internal state, they cannot easily be created or
updated via operators.  Instead, the execution of the job, or the
triggering of some other action, will cause a task to spring into
existence and move through its lifecycle.


### GET /v2/tenants/:tenant/tasks

Retrieve all tasks for a tenant.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/tenants/:tenant/tasks
```

- **?active=(t|f)**
When filtering tasks, show those that are active (true) or inactive (false)


- **?status=...**
Only show tasks whose status matches the given value.  


- **?target=**
Only show tasks associated with a given target...


- **?limit=N**
Limit the returned result set to the first _limit_ users
that match the other filtering rules.  A limit of `0` (the
default) denotes an unlimited search.




**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "uuid"         : "df2fd352-83b8-45b8-8f7b-ef74cf9eafdc",

- **Unable to retrieve backup archive information**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **No such backup archive**:
  You requested details on an archive that either doesn't exist, or
  is not tied to the given tenant.

- **Unable to update backup archive**:
  an internal error occurred and should be investigated by the
  site administrators

- **Authorization required**:
  The request was made without an authenticated session or auth token.
  See **Authentication** for more details.  The request may be retried
  after authentication.

### POST /v2/tenants/:tenant/archives/:uuid/restore

Restore a backup archive for a tenant, either to the original
target system it was taken from, or against a different target
owned by the same tenant.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST https://shield.host/v2/tenants/:tenant/archives/:uuid/restore \
     --data-binary '
{
  "target" : "2a1731c0-7d0e-4f31-8860-7d0ae7a34261"
}'
```

Here, `target` is an optional UUID of an alternative data system
to restore this archive to.  This target must exist inside the
same tenant.  By default, if `target` is omitted, the archive
will be restored back to the target it was created from.

**Response**

When a restore has been scheduled for execution, it generates a
task inside of SHIELD, which is then returned as the result to
the requester:

```json
{
  "uuid"         : "df2fd352-83b8-45b8-8f7b-ef74cf9eafdc",
  "owner"        : "user@backend",
  "type"         : "restore",
  "job_uuid"     : "bd2c5ac0-b499-4085-857e-69fa38441419",
  "archive_uuid" : "eb096379-7c45-4679-9b47-c563276dc22e",
  "status"       : "running",
  "started_at"   : "2017-10-17 04:51:16",
  "stopped_at"   : "",
  "log"          : "running log...",
  "notes"        : "Annotated notes about this task",
  "clear"        : "manual"
}
```

The `type` of this task will always be `restore`, and usually,
`log` will be empty and `stopped_at` will have no value, since
the task hasn't had time to run to completion.

## SHIELD Global Resources

Some resources are shared between tenants, either implicitly via
copying (like retention policies), or explicitly (like shared
storage system definitions).

Retrieve all globally-defined stores.


**Request**

```sh
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        https://shield.host/v2/global/stores
```

- **?exact=(t|f)**
When filtering stores, perform either exact field / value
matching (`exact=t`), or fuzzy search (`exact=f`, the
default)


- **?unused=(t|f)**
When filtering stores, skip those that are unused (true) or used (false)


- **?name=...**
Only show stores whose name matches the given value.  
Subject to the `exact=(t|f)` query string parameter.


- **?plugin=...**
Only show stores who are associated with the given plugin.
Subject to the `exact=(t|f)` query string parameter.


- **?limit=N**
Limit the returned result set to the first _limit_ users
that match the other filtering rules.  A limit of `0` (the
default) denotes an unlimited search.




**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "uuid"    : "925c83ad-22e6-4cdd-bf63-6dd6d09cd86f",
    "name"    : "Cloud Storage Name",
