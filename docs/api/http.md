# HTTP API

## Status API

Purpose: allows the Web UI and CLI to ask the SHIELD installation
for information about itself, including the version of the
software, the name of the installation, etc.

| Method | Path | Arguments | Request Body |
| :----- | :--- | :-------- | :----------- |
| GET | /v1/status | - | - |
| GET | /v1/status/internal | - | - |
| GET | /v1/status/jobs | - | - |

### GET /v1/status

Response Body:

```json
{
    "name"    : "My SHIELD installation",
    "version" : "1.0"
}
```

#### GET /v1/status/internal

This API emits information about the _internals_ of the SHIELD
supervisor.  This information is highly technical, and intended
mostly for debugging and diagnostic purposes.

```json
{
    "pending_tasks"  : [],
    "running_tasks"  : [],
    "schedule_queue" : [],
    "run_queue"      : [
        {
            "uuid"         : "f8ce4cf8-1bf9-4f9a-9dc9-052157b57b69",
            "owner"        : "anon",
            "type"         : "backup",
            "job_uuid"     : "c8d52fec-1dc3-4512-b81f-b764281bb5ef",
            "archive_uuid" : "",
            "status"       : "pending",
            "started_at"   : "",
            "stopped_at"   : "",
            "log"          : ""
        }
    ]
}
```

The top-level keys are:

  - **pending_tasks** - Tasks marked as "pending" in the database.
  - **running_tasks** - Tasks marked as "running" in the database.
  - **schedule_queue** - Tasks in the supervisor scheduler queue.
    These tasks will be executed on the next scheduler run, if a
    worker is available.
  - **run_queue** - Tasks in the supervisor run queue.  These
    tasks are currently running on a worker.

**NOTE:** this endpoint is subject to change without notice.  Do
not rely on the contents, semantics, or format of the response
body.  The documentation presented here is informative only.

#### GET /v1/status/jobs

This API emits information about the success or failure of the
most recent task associated with a job.  This information is
intended to be used with a monitoring system to alert on job health.

```json
{
  "My job": {
    "name": "My job",
    "last_run": 1492698300,
    "next_run": 1492701900,
    "paused": false,
    "status": "done"
  }
}

For alerting purposes the following alerts are suggested:

 - A job where `status` is "failed" and `paused` is false
 - A job which has exceeded `next_run` by more than the difference
   between `next_run` and `last_run` and `paused` is false
 - There are no `paused` false jobs at all
```


## Retention Policies API

## Archive API

Purpose: allows end-users and operators to see what backups have been performed, optionally filtering them to specific targets (just the Cloud Foundry postgres database please), stores (what’s in S3?) and time windows (only show me backups before that data corruption incident).  It also facilitates restoration of data, and purging of backups ahead of schedule.

Note: the PUT /v1/archive/:uuid endpoint is only able to update the annotations (name and summary) for an archive.

| Method | Path | Arguments | Request Body |

## Meta API

Purpose: provides public (non-sensitive) information about the
Shield daemon.

| Method | Path | Arguments | Request Body |
| :----- | :---- | :------- | :----------- |
| GET | /v1/meta/pubkey | - | - |

### GET /v1/meta/pubkey

```txt
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC5X75B52xHxfDeujUiKNk9t2jZTR6FIb02t9pUcE6yfwItKGEM8wEad5TVtAqrqdiOaZoosYzcXzzcM2JXsGaCqhVyf2oNaQHiPuyLufPdPW3ZE6omKfHlwL32PkdK4XtZQIwwLEK4NScp1Gvi8GMF90JSaPOQuKgpXCiDXQWFuQkPUzu6yIQIkhPCthtLRn31Td/zF92vBdr5VXyjQ1j8lFTO0jrw9nqwnrW3SA6b1FToSaLvXJJvV8De1Vlkl030tzVdYA4KPIZFX7IPPueVBJcqCaXxEMSzceknGTXP7r64oJDJw4vE39pYqCYtllhzOKKYVaDTHoUUBsZQu+e5 core@shield
```

This can be used by agents to auto-authorize the core daemon for
remote operations, rather than having to specify the key
out-of-band.  There are security risks involved in using this
feature, so be consider the potential for MitM attacks and act
accordingly.
