SHIELD Development
==================

This document contains notes on SHIELD, Golang, and life in
general, that are only of interest to people writing SHIELD code
itself.

Golang Dependencies
-------------------

We have ditched `godep` in favor of `govendor`.  You can install
`govendor` like this:

```
go get github.com/kardianos/govendor
go install github.com/kardianos/govendor
```

To **remove a dependency** that we no longer need:

```
govendor remove github.com/markbates/goth/gothic
```

To **add a new dependency** manually:

```
govendor add github.com/jhunt/go-cli
```

To **add all new dependencies, automagically**:

```
govendor add +external
```

To **prune the vendored dependencies**:

```
govendor remove +unused
```

To **see what is currently unnused**:

```
govendor list +unused
```
