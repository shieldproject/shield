## Dev Setup

```
PATH=.../s3cli/out:$PATH bin/run -P ubuntu -C path_to_config.json
```

### Running locally

To start server locally:

    gem install nats
    nats-server

To subscribe:

    nats-sub '>' -s nats://localhost:4222

To publish:

    nats-pub agent.123-456-789 '{"method":"apply","arguments":[{"packages":[{"name":"package-name", "version":"package-version"}]}]}' -s nats://localhost:4222

### Blobstores

The Go Agent ships with 5 default blobstores:

- Local filesystem
- S3
- GCS (Google Cloud Storage)
- DAV
- Dummy (for testing)

You can, however, use custom blobstores by implementing a simple interface. For example, if you want to use a blobstore named "custom" you need to create an executable named `bosh-blobstore-custom` somewhere in `PATH`. This executable must conform to the following command line interface:

- `-c` flag that specifies a config file path (this will be passed to every call to the executable)
- must parse the config file in JSON format
- must respond to `get <blobID> <filename>` by placing the file identified by the blobID into the filename specified
- must respond to `put <filename> <blobID>` by storing the file at filename into the blobstore at the specified blobID

A full call might look like:

    bosh-blobstore-custom -c /var/vcap/bosh/etc/blobstore-custom.json get 2340958ddfg /tmp/my-cool-file

### Set up a workstation for development

Note: This guide assumes a few things:

- You have gcc (or an equivalent)
- You can install packages (brew, apt-get, or equivalent)

Get Golang and its dependencies (Mac example, replace with your package manager of choice):

- `brew update`
- `brew install go`
- `brew install git` (Go needs git for the `go get` command)
- `brew install hg` (Go needs mercurial for the `go get` command)

Clone and set up the BOSH Agent repository:

- `go get -d github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent`
    - Note that this will print an error message because it expects a single package; our repository consists of several packages.
      The error message is harmlessâ€”the repository will still be checked out.
- `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent`

From here on out we assume you're working in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent`

Install tools used by the BOSH Agent test suite:

- `bin/go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/vet`
- `bin/go get github.com/golang/lint/golint`

#### Updating dependencies

All dependencies:

```
./update-dep github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-utils/...
```

An example for a single dependency:

```
./update-dep github.com/pivotal-golang/clock/fakeclock
```

The script will pull latest package version and copy its files to vendor directory. Note, that it does not pull dependecies recursively from package unless they are vendored.

For development purposes, delete package from vendor use it from your $GOPATH. Once everything works in other package push changes in that package to github and run ./update-dep to add latest version.

Every vendored packaged is recorded in deps.txt with git/hg sha of the package for references. The known issue if subpackages are being vendored and later full package is being vendored subpackage references are not deleted in deps.txt.

To delete package  `rm -rf vendor/path_to_package` and delete reference in deps.txt.

#### Running tests

Each package in the agent has its own unit tests. You can run all unit tests with `bin/test-unit`.

Additionally, [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) includes integration tests that use this agent.
Run `bin/test-bosh-integration` to run those with your local agent changes.
However, in order to run the BOSH integrations tests, you will need a copy of the BOSH repo, which this script will do in `./tmp`.
BOSH uses Ruby for its tests, so you will also need to have that available.

You can run all the tests by running `bin/test`.

There is a stand-alone _BOSH Agent_ integration test to test config-drive using bosh-lite. This can be run locally via `bin/test-integration --provider=virtualbox`. The vagrant provider passed in can be changed to a provider of your choosing if you so desire.

#### Using IntelliJ with Go and the BOSH Agent

- Install [IntelliJ 15](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html)
- Install the latest [Google Go plugin for IntelliJ](https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin). You may want to grab the latest early access (EAP) build, rather than the last release.
- (Optional) Download, Install & Select [improved keybindings](https://github.com/Pivotal-Boulder/IDE-Preferences) for IntelliJ:
    - `git clone git@github.com:Pivotal-Boulder/IDE-Preferences.git`
    - `cd ~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea13/keymaps`
    - `ln -sf ~/workspace/IDE-Preferences/IntelliJKeymap.xml`
    - In IntelliJ: Preferences -> Keymap -> Pick 'Mac OS X 10.5+ Improved'
- Clone bosh-agent into a clean go workspace (or use a [bosh](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) clone with bosh/go as the workspace root):
    - `mkdir -p ~/workspace/bosh-agent-workspace/src/github.com/cloudfoundry`
    - `cd ~/workspace/bosh-agent-workspace/src/github.com/cloudfoundry`
    - `git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent`
- Open ~/workspace/bosh-agent-workspace as a new project in IntelliJ.
- Set the Go SDK as the Project SDK:
    - Open the Project Structure window: `File -> Project Structure`
    - Select the `Project` tab in left sidebar
    - (Optional) Add a `New` Go SDK by selecting your go root.
    - Select `Go SDK go1.3` under Project SDK
- Setup module sources
    - Open the Project Structure window: `File -> Project Structure`
    - Select the `Modules` tab in left sidebar
    - Select your module in the middle sidebar
    - Select the `Sources` tab in the Module pane
    - Select ~/workspace/bosh-agent-workspace/src and add is as a source dir
- Install & configure the [Grep Console](https://github.com/krasa/GrepConsole) plugin
    - Install via `Preferences -> Plugins`
    - Select `Preferences -> Grep COnsole -> Enable ANSI coloring` to colorize Ginkgo test output
- Re-index your project: `File -> Invalidate Cache / Restart`

You should now be able to 'go to declaration', auto-complete, and run tests from within IntelliJ.
