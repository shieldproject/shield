# Okta JWT Verifier for Golang

This library helps you verify tokens that have been issued by Okta. To learn more about verification cases and Okta's tokens please read [Working With OAuth 2.0 Tokens](https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/tokens/)

## Release status

This library uses semantic versioning and follows Okta's [library version policy](https://developer.okta.com/code/library-versions/).

| Version | Status                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0.x     | :warning: Beta Release (Retired) |
| 1.x     | :heavy_check_mark: Release       |

## Installation

```sh
go get -u github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang
```

## Usage

This library was built to keep configuration to a minimum. To get it running at its most basic form, all you need to provide is the the following information:

- **Issuer** - This is the URL of the authorization server that will perform authentication. All Developer Accounts have a "default" authorization server. The issuer is a combination of your Org URL (found in the upper right of the console home page) and `/oauth2/default`. For example, `https://dev-1234.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default`.
- **Client ID**- These can be found on the "General" tab of the Web application that you created earlier in the Okta Developer Console.

#### Access Token Validation

```go
import "github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang"

toValidate := map[string]string{}
toValidate["aud"] = "api://default"
toValidate["cid"] = "{CLIENT_ID}"

jwtVerifierSetup := jwtverifier.JwtVerifier{
        Issuer: "{ISSUER}",
        ClaimsToValidate: toValidate,
}

verifier := jwtVerifierSetup.New()

token, err := verifier.VerifyAccessToken("{JWT}")
```

#### Id Token Validation

```go
import "github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang"

toValidate := map[string]string{}
toValidate["nonce"] = "{NONCE}"
toValidate["aud"] = "{CLIENT_ID}"


jwtVerifierSetup := jwtverifier.JwtVerifier{
        Issuer: "{ISSUER}",
        ClaimsToValidate: toValidate,
}

verifier := jwtVerifierSetup.New()

token, err := verifier.VerifyIdToken("{JWT}")
```

This will either provide you with the token which gives you access to all the claims, or an error. The token struct contains a `Claims` property that will give you a `map[string]interface{}` of all the claims in the token.

```go
// Getting the sub from the token
sub := token.Claims["sub"]
```

#### Dealing with clock skew

We default to a two minute clock skew adjustment in our validation. If you need to change this, you can use the `SetLeeway` method:

```go
jwtVerifierSetup := JwtVerifier{
        Issuer: "{ISSUER}",
}

verifier := jwtVerifierSetup.New()
verifier.SetLeeway("2m") //String instance of time that will be parsed by `time.ParseDuration`
```

#### Customizable Resource Cache

The verifier setup has a default cache based on
[`patrickmn/go-cache`](https://github.com/patrickmn/go-cache) with a 5 minute
expiry and 10 minute purge setting that is used to store resources fetched over
HTTP. It also defines a `Cacher` interface with a `Get` method allowing
customization of that caching. If you want to establish your own caching
strategy then provide your own `Cacher` object that implements that interface.
Your custom cache is set in the verifier via the `Cache` attribute. See the
example in the [cache example test](utils/cache_example_test.go) that shows a
"forever" cache (that one would never use in production ...)

```go
jwtVerifierSetup := jwtverifier.JwtVerifier{
    Cache: NewForeverCache,
    // other fields here
}

verifier := jwtVerifierSetup.New()
```

#### Utilities

The below utilities are available in this package that can be used for Authentication flows

**Nonce Generator**

```go
import jwtUtils "github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang/utils"

nonce, err := jwtUtils.GenerateNonce()
```

**PKCE Code Verifier and Challenge Generator**

```go
import jwtUtils "github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang/utils"

codeVerifier, err := jwtUtils.GenerateCodeVerifier()
// or
codeVerifier, err := jwtUtils.GenerateCodeVerifierWithLength(50)

// get string value for oauth2 code verifier
codeVerifierValue := codeVerifier.String()

// get plain text code challenge from verifier
codeChallengePlain := codeVerifier.CodeChallengePlain()
codeChallengeMethod := "plain"
// get sha256 code challenge from verifier
codeChallengeS256 := codeVerifier.CodeChallengeS256()
codeChallengeMethod := "S256"
```

## Testing

If you create a PR from a fork of okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang the build for
the PR will fail. Don't worry, we'll bring your commits into a review branch in
okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang and get a green build.

jwtverifier_test.go expects environment variables for `ISSUER`, `CLIENT_ID`,
`USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD` to be present. Take note if you use zshell as
`USERSNAME` is a special environment variable and is not settable. Therefore
tests shouldn't be run in zshell.

`USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` are for a user with access to the test app associated
with `CLIENT_ID`. The test app should not have 2FA enabled and allow password
login. The General Settings for the test app should have Application Grant type
with Implicit (hybrid) enabled.

```
go test -test.v
```
