USAGE: @G{buckler} purge-archive --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{UUID}

  Remove a Backup Archive from Cloud Storage.

  When SHIELD successfully performs a backup operation, it generates
  a backup archive containing all of the protected data form that
  particular system, at that particular point in time.  This archive
  is then placed in cloud storage, awaiting either expiry and purgation,
  or restoration to a data system.

  When you purge a backup archive, it will be remmoved from its cloud
  storage system, and marked as purged in the SHIELD database; no one
  will be able to restore the data in the archvie.

  @R{This is a dangerous operation that cannot be undone.}
