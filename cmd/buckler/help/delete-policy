  Delete a Retention Policy

  No backup is good forever.  SHIELD utilizes retention policies
  to automatically expire backup archives that are too old, and
  automatically remove them from cloud storage.

  @Y{NOTE:} You will only be able to delete @W{unused} retention
  policies; if the policy is being referenced by any backup job
  configuration, you will be unable to delete it.
