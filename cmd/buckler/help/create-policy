  Create a new Retention Policy

  No backup is good forever.  SHIELD utilizes retention policies
  to automatically expire backup archives that are too old, and
  automatically remove them from cloud storage.

@B{Options:}

  The entire configuration of the new Retention Policy can be
  specified via command-line arguments.  You may also omit any or
  all of these flags and buckler will prompt interactively for the
  missing information it needs (unless @C{--batch} is active.)

  -n, --name      The name of your new Retention Policy.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -s, --summary   An optional, long-form description for the policy.

  -d, --days      How many days to keep backup archives for.
                  This field is @W{required}, and must be a positive,
                  non-zero, whole number.

@B{Example:}

  # Create a short-term policy
  @W{buckler create-policy}                  \
      @Y{--name}     Short-Term              \
      @Y{--summary}  "For frequent backups." \
      @Y{--days}     14
