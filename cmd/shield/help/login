  Authenticate to a SHIELD Core.

  There are three ways to authenticate to a SHIELD Core: local user
  authentication, auth tokens, and 3rd-party provider authentication.
  Each way has its own set of options, and its own applications.

@B{Local User Authentication:}

  -u, --username ...    Who to log in as. (@W{$SHIELD_CORE_USERNAME})
  -p, --password ...    Secret password.  (@W{$SHIELD_CORE_PASSWORD})

@B{Token Authentication:}

      --token ...       Auth Token to use. (@W{$SHIELD_CORE_TOKEN})

@B{3rd-Party Authentication}

      --providers       List the 3rd-party authentication providers
                        that have been configured by the SHIELD site
                        operators, and are usable by @B{--via}.

      --via ...         Which 3rd-party authentication provider to
                        use for logging in.
