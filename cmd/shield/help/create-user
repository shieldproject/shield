USAGE: @G{shield} create-user [OPTIONS]

  Create a new local SHIELD User.

  SHIELD supports a several 3rd party authentication providers,
  including Github and Cloud Foundry UAA, but for sheer simplicity,
  nothing beats local users.  Local SHIELD users exist inside the
  SHIELD database, and can be assigned tenant- and system-roles
  arbitrarily.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command can only be used by SHIELD site managers.

@B{Options:}

  The entire configuration of the new local SHIELD user can be
  specified via command-line arguments.  You may also omit any or
  all of these flags and shield will prompt interactively for the
  missing information it needs (unless @C{--batch} is active.)

  -n, --name        The full display name of your new user.

  -u, --username    The username this user will use to sign in.
                    This field is @W{required}.

  -p, --password    A secret password that the user must supply
                    in order to authenticate successfully.
                    This field is @W{required}.

     --system-role  Optionally assign this new user a system role,
                    one of @M{engineer}, @M{manager}, or @M{admin}.

@B{System Roles:}

  Assigning a user a System Role grants them special access into
  SHIELD itself, giving them the ability to view and modify the
  configuration of the software, authentication, tenancy, etc.

  The following system roles are defined:

    @M{admin}     Complete access to SHIELD, including the ability
              to view and manage registered agents, manage user
              sessions, and more.

    @M{manager}   System Managers are responsible for the creation
              and management of SHIELD Tenants; they have the
              ability to invite and banish users to / from any
              tenant.  They also manage local SHIELD users.

    @M{engineer}  Full access to everything that is shared between
              tenants, namely cloud storage systems.

@B{Example:}

  # We want jhunt engineering stuff on our SHIELD.
  @W{shield create-user}             \
      @Y{--name}        "James Hunt" \
      @Y{--username}    jhunt        \
      @Y{--password}    sekrit       \
      @Y{--system-role} engineer
