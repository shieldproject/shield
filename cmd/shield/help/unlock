USAGE: @G{shield} unlock [--master @Y{PASSWORD}]

  Unlock a SHIELD Core.

  SHIELD maintains an internal encrypted vault of secrets,
  for protecting your data archives with strong encryption.
  Before SHIELD will be able to use this vault, it needs to
  be unlocked, using the SHIELD master password.

@B{Options:}

  --master ...    Master password. (@W{$SHIELD_CORE_MASTER})

  In general, use of the command-line flag is discouraged.
  Instead, for automation purposes, set @W{$SHIELD_CORE_MASTER}
  in your environment.

  For interactive use, not specifying @M{--master} causes shield
  to prompt you for the master password, with appropriate
  security precautions (no terminal echo)
