USAGE: @G{shield} archives --tenant @Y{TENANT}

  List Backup Archives.

  When SHIELD successfully performs a backup operation, it generates
  a backup archive containing all of the protected data form that
  particular system, at that particular point in time.  This archive
  is then placed in cloud storage, awaiting either expiry and purgation,
  or restoration to a data system.

@B{Options:}

  By default, the most recent 1000 archives, valid, purged, or otherwise,
  are displayed.  You may filter the results with the following flags.

      --target   Show archives for the given target, specified either by
                 name or UUID.

      --store    Show archives housed in the given cloud storage system,
                 specified either by name or UUID.

  -l, --limit    Only show the given number of archives.
