USAGE: @G{shield} create-store --tenant @Y{TENANT} [OPTIONS]

  Create a new Cloud Storage System

  SHIELD needs a place to store all of the backup archives it is
  going to generate, and Cloud Storage is where it's at.  Each
  Cloud Storage System provides the configuration details needed
  to write to and read from some external storage endpoint, be it
  Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a local WebDav instance.

  @Y{NOTE:} Storage Systems created by this command will only be
  visible to and accessible from a single SHIELD Tenant.  If you
  want to create shared storage, see @C{shield create-global-store}.

@B{Options:}

  The entire configuration of the new Cloud Storage System can be
  specified via command-line arguments.  You may also omit any or
  all of these flags and shield will prompt interactively for the
  missing information it needs (unless @C{--batch} is active.)

  -n, --name      The name of your new Cloud Storage System.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -s, --summary   An optional, long-form description for the new
                  storage system.

  -a, --agent     The address (in ip:port format) of the SHIELD
                  Agent that will be used for testing access to
                  the storage system, and also for purging expired
                  or manually deleted backup archives.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -p, --plugin    The name of the plugin binary to use.  The chosen
                  plugin must support "store" operations, and must
                  be available on the selected agent.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -d, --data      Configuration data for the storage plugin, in the
                  format @Y{--data} @G{key_name}=@C{value}.  Note that you may
                  be required to quote this to avoid tokenization of
                  the provided value by your shell.

                  This field is optional, and may be specified multiple
                  times, either to provide new configuration key / values,
                  or to override configuration specified earlier in the
                  command-line invocation.

@B{Example:}

  # Create an authenticated WebDAV storage system:
  @W{shield create-store}                      \
      @Y{--name}    "Local WebDAV"             \
      @Y{--agent}   10.0.0.42:5444             \
      @Y{--plugin}  @B{webdav}                     \
      @Y{--data}    @G{url}=@C{https://10.0.0.42:8443} \
      @Y{--data}    @G{username}=@C{webdave}           \
      @Y{--data}    @G{password}=@C{super-sekrit}
