USAGE: @G{shield} help @Y{COMMAND}

  Help, I need somebody
  Help, not just anybody
  Help, you know I need someone, help

  When I was younger, so much younger than today
  I never needed anybody's help in any way
  But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
  Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

  Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
  And I do appreciate you being round
  Help me get my feet back on the ground
  Won't you please, please help me

  And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
  My independence seems to vanish in the haze
  But every now and then I feel so insecure
  I know that I just need you like I've never done before

  Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
  And I do appreciate you being round
  Help me get my feet back on the ground
  Won't you please, please help me

  When I was younger, so much younger than today
  I never needed anybody's help in any way
  But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
  Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

  Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
  And I do appreciate you being round
  Help me get my feet back on the ground
  Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh
