  List Retention Policies

  No backup is good forever.  SHIELD utilizes retention policies
  to automatically expire backup archives that are too old, and
  automatically remove them from cloud storage.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all defined retention policies will be displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  --used          Only show storage systems that are either @W{used}
  --unused        (referenced by a job configurtion) or @W{unused}.
                  These options are mutually exclusive.
