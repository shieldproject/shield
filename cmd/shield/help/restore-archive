USAGE: @G{shield} restore-archive --tenant @Y{TENANT} [OPTIONS] @Y{UUID}

  Restore a Backup Archive.

  When SHIELD successfully performs a backup operation, it generates
  a backup archive containing all of the protected data form that
  particular system, at that particular point in time.  This archive
  is then placed in cloud storage, awaiting either expiry and purgation,
  or restoration to a data system.

  You are not constrained to restoring a backup archive to the target
  system it was generated from.  This allows you to migrate data by
  way of the backup system.

  @R{NOTE: Restoring data may cause an outage} in the target data system
  as the data is replayed.  SHIELD cannot guarantee that plugins will not
  disconnect end users, block new connections, prohibit writes to the data
  store, etc.  Please consult your plugin documentation.

@B{Options:}

  --to, --target   The name or UUID of an alternate target data system
                   to restore the data to.  By default, archives will
                   be restored to their originating target system.
