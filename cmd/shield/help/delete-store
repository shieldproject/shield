USAGE: @G{shield} delete-store --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Delete a Cloud Storage System

  SHIELD needs a place to store all of the backup archives it is
  going to generate, and Cloud Storage is where it's at.  Each
  Cloud Storage System provides the configuration details needed
  to write to and read from some external storage endpoint, be it
  Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a local WebDav instance.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command can only be used to delete Storage Systems
  for a single SHIELD Tenant.  If you need to manage shared storage,
  see @C{shield delete-global-store}.

  @Y{ALSO NOTE:} You will only be able to delete @W{unused} storage
  systems; if the system is being referenced by any backup job
  configuration, you will be unable to delete it.
