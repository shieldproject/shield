USAGE: @G{shield} create-target --tenant @Y{TENANT} [OPTIONS]

  Create a new Target Data System.

  SHIELD needs to know what you want it to back up, which is why
  it defines Target Data Systems.  These can be anything from
  "that directory over there" to "all of these databases" -- if
  there exists a target plugin for it, you can back it up.

@B{Options:}

  The entire configuration of the new Target Data System can be
  specified via command-line arguments.  You may also omit any or
  all of these flags and shield will prompt interactively for the
  missing information it needs (unless @C{--batch} is active.)

  -n, --name      The name of your new Target Data System.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -s, --summary   An optional, long-form description for the new
                  data system.

  -a, --agent     The address (in ip:port format) of the SHIELD
                  Agent that will be used for running backup and
                  restore operations.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -p, --plugin    The name of the plugin binary to use.  The chosen
                  plugin must support "target" operations, and must
                  be available on the selected agent.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -C, --compression
                  The type of compression to use when backing up this
                  target. Valid values are `bzip2' and `none'. Defaults
                  to `bzip2'.

  -d, --data      Configuration data for the target plugin, in the
                  format @Y{--data} @G{key_name}=@C{value}.  Note that you may
                  be required to quote this to avoid tokenization of
                  the provided value by your shell.

                  This field is optional, and may be specified multiple
                  times, either to provide new configuration key / values,
                  or to override configuration specified earlier in the
                  command-line invocation.

@B{Example:}

  # We want to back up files on 10.0.0.5:
  @W{shield create-target}                  \
      @Y{--name}    "Important Files"       \
      @Y{--agent}   10.0.0.5:5444           \
      @Y{--plugin}  @B{fs}                      \
      @Y{--data}    @G{base_dir}=@C{/path/to/files} \
      @Y{--data}    @G{exclude}=@C{*.bak}
