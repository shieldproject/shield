USAGE: @G{shield} invite [--role @Y{ROLE}] --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{USER}

  Invite a local user into a SHIELD Tenant.

  Each SHIELD Core defines one or more tenants, each with their own
  set of cloud storage configurations, data systems, and backup jobs.

  Local users (accounts defined wholly within SHIELD itself) can be
  arbitrarily assigned to those tenants, and given one of three roles:

    @M{admin}   Complete access to the tenant, including the ability
                  to invite new users and banish existing users.

    @M{engineer}  Full control of the configuration of SHIELD within the
                  tenant.  Engineers have the ability to reconfigure
                  cloud storage, data systems, and backup jobs.

    @M{operator}  Day-to-day backup-related activities including running
                  ad hoc backup jobs, performing restores, pausing and
                  unpausing jobs, etc.

  Each more powerful role includes the rights of the roles beneath.
  For example, a @M{admin} can do everything an @M{engineer} can do,
  and an @M{engineer} can do everything an @M{operator} can do.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command is only available to @R{SHIELD Site Managers},
        and @R{SHIELD Tenant Managers}.

  This command only operates on one (user,tenant) pairing at a time.
  For bulk operations, either avail yourself of the SHIELD API, or run
  the command multiple times.

@B{Options:}

  -r, --role     The role to assign the new user.  Must be one of
                 @M{admin}, @M{engineer}, or @M{operator}.
