USAGE: @G{shield} create-policy-template [OPTIONS]

  Create a new Retention Policy Template

  No backup is good forever.  SHIELD utilizes retention policies
  to automatically expire backup archives that are too old, and
  automatically remove them from cloud storage.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command manages @W{templates} for retention
  policies, which are copied over to new SHIELD Tenants when they
  are first created.  Only SHIELD site engineers can use this
  command; for managing retention policies in your own tenant(s),
  see @C{shield create-policy}.

@B{Options:}

  The entire configuration of the new policy template can be
  specified via command-line arguments.  You may also omit any or
  all of these flags and shield will prompt interactively for the
  missing information it needs (unless @C{--batch} is active.)

  -n, --name      The name of your new Retention Policy.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -s, --summary   An optional, long-form description for the policy.

  -d, --days      How many days to keep backup archives for.
                  This field is @W{required}, and must be a positive,
                  non-zero, whole number.
