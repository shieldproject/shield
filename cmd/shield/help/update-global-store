USAGE: @G{shield} update-global-store [OPTIONS] @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Update an existing Shared Cloud Storage System

  SHIELD needs a place to store all of the backup archives it is
  going to generate, and Cloud Storage is where it's at.  Each
  Cloud Storage System provides the configuration details needed
  to write to and read from some external storage endpoint, be it
  Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a local WebDav instance.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command manages existing shared storage systems,
  and you must be a SHIELD site engineer to use it.  For managing
  storage defined for your tenant(s), see @C{shield update-store}.

@B{Options:}

  Updates are entirely specified via command-line arguments.

  -n, --name        A new name for the Cloud Storage System.

  -s, --summary     An optional, long-form description for the
                    storage system.

  -a, --agent       The address (in ip:port format) of the SHIELD
                    Agent that will be used for testing access to
                    the storage system, and also for purging expired
                    or manually deleted backup archives.

  -p, --plugin      The name of the plugin binary to use.  The chosen
                    plugin must support "store" operations, and must
                    be available on the selected agent.

      --clear-data  Clear the plugin configuration before applying new
                    configuration from @Y{--data ...} flags.  If not
                    specified, existing keys will be left alone, new
                    keys will be added, and overridden keys will be
                    updated.

  -d, --data        Configuration data for the storage plugin, in the
                    format @Y{--data} @G{key_name}=@C{value}.  Note that you may
                    be required to quote this to avoid tokenization of
                    the provided value by your shell.

                    This field may be specified multiple times, either 
                    to provide new configuration key / values, or to
                    override configuration specified earlier in the
                    command-line invocation.

@B{Examples:}

  # Rename "Local WebDAV" storage to just "WebDAV":
  @W{shield update-global-store} "Local WebDAV" \
      @Y{--name} WebDAV

  # Change the credentials for accessing the WebDAV Store
  @W{shield update-global-store} WebDAV \
      @Y{--data} @G{username}=@C{new-webdave}    \
      @Y{--data} @G{password}=@C{dont-forget-it}
