USAGE: @G{shield} create-job [OPTIONS]

  Configure a new Backup Job.

  Backup Jobs are the linchpin of SHIELD configuration; they
  provide the what, when, and where, tying together target data
  systems (the "what"), cloud storage ("where"), a schedule, and
  a retention policy into one schedulable unit of data protection.

@B{Options:}

  -n, --name      A name for your backup job.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  -s, --summary   An optional, long-form description for the job.

  --target        The name or UUID of the target data system that
                  you want SHIELD to back up.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  --bucket        The name or key of the cloud storage bucket to
                  store backup archives in.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  --schedule      A @W{timespec} schedule description (see below),
                  instructing SHIELD how to schedule this job.
                  This field is @W{required}.

  --retain        How long to keep backup archives.  Can be given
                  in days (7d) or weeks (5w).
                  This field is @W{required}.

  --paused        Don't schedule this job; in order for it to run,
                  an operator will have to manually kick it off.

  --fixed-key     Encrypt backup archives with the fixed key.
                  Backups of SHIELD itself should use this option
                  to enable recovery in a disaster scenario

  In @Y{--batch} mode, the name or UUID specified on the command-line
  must be "unique enough" for shield to determine what you meant.
  In interactive mode, you will be asked to narrow your search
  parameters if necessary.

@B{Example:}

  @W{shield create-job}                 \
      @Y{--batch}                       \
      @Y{--name}      Daily             \
      @Y{--target}    "Important Files" \
      @Y{--bucket}    "remote1"         \
      @Y{--schedule}  "daily 4am"       \
      @Y{--retain}    14d

@B{Scheduling Syntax:}

  SHIELD uses a thing called @W{Timespec} for specifying job schedules.
  This mini-language is intended to be intuitive and readable.

  Here are some examples.

    @C{daily 4am}           Runs every day at 4:00 in the morning.

    @C{every 2h from 0:15}  Run at 0:15, 2:15, 4:15, etc...

    @C{sundays at 16:32}    Runs weekly, on Sundays, at 4:32 in the afternoon.
