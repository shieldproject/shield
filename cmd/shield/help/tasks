USAGE: @G{shield} tasks --tenant @Y{TENANT}

  List SHIELD Tasks.

  Whenever SHIELD needs to perform some bit of work, it generates a
  task object to keep track of the state of that work and hand it off
  to the various workers and SHIELD agents that will be responsible
  for seeing that the work gets done.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all active SHIELD tasks for the given tenant are displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  -s, --status   Only show tasks that have the given status.
                 The following status values are defined:

                   @M{pending}    The task has not been started

                   @M{scheduled}  The task has been sent to a SHIELD
                              worker thread to be executed.

                   @M{running}    The worker thread that received the
                              task has started executing it.

                   @M{canceled}   An operator canceled this task
                              before it finished on its own.

                   @M{failed}     The task has finished, but there
                              was an unrecoverable error.

                   @M{done}       The task finished succesfully.

                 Additionally, you can use the special status @M{all}
                 to show all tasks, regardless of their status.


      --active   Only show tasks that are still running (@W{active}),
    --inactive   or that are no longer running (@W{inactive}).

      --target   Show tasks that are associated with the given target,
                 either by name or UUID.

  -a, --all      Show all tasks, overriding the @Y{--status} flag.

  -l, --limit    Only show the given number of tasks.
