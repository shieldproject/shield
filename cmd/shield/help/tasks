USAGE: @G{shield} tasks --tenant @Y{TENANT}

  List SHIELD Tasks.

  Whenever SHIELD needs to perform some bit of work, it generates a
  task object to keep track of the state of that work and hand it off
  to the various workers and SHIELD agents that will be responsible
  for seeing that the work gets done.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all active SHIELD tasks for the given tenant are displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  -s, --status   Only show tasks that have the given status.

                   @M{scheduled}  The task has been sent to a SHIELD
                              worker thread to be executed.

                   @M{running}    The worker thread that received the

                   @M{done}       The task finished succesfully.
