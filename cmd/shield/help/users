USAGE: @G{shield} users [OPTIONS]

  List local SHIELD Users.

  SHIELD supports a several 3rd party authentication providers,
  including Github and Cloud Foundry UAA, but for sheer simplicity,
  nothing beats local users.  Local SHIELD users exist inside the
  SHIELD database, and can be assigned system-roles arbitrarily.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command can only be used by SHIELD managers.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all local SHIELD users will be displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  --with-system-role  Only show users who have been assigned the
                      specified system role, one of either @M{admin},
                      @M{manager}, @M{engineer}, or @M{operator}.

@B{Examples:}

  # Who can manage local accounts?
  @W{shield users} \
     @Y{--with-system-role} @C{manager}
