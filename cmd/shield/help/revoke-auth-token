USAGE: @G{shield} revoke-auth-token

  Revoke an issued authentication token.

  SHIELD users can issue @W{authentication tokens}, which can be
  used in scripts and other automatons to represent the issuing
  account, and all of their privileges within the system.

  This command contacts your currently targeted SHIELD Core, and
  asks it to revoke a specific authentication token.  Once revoked,
  that token will no longer be usable to authentication to SHIELD.
