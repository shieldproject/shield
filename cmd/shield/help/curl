USAGE: @G{shield} curl [@Y{METHOD}] @Y{RELATIVE-URL} [@Y{BODY}]

  Issues raw HTTP requests to the targeted SHIELD Core.

  Any valid HTTP method can be provided, but shield will default to
  using @M{GET}.  Some HTTP methods, like POST and PUT, may require
  that you supply a request body, like the JSON for updating a target
  data system.

  If you are using shield curl to debug and/or troubleshoot your
  SHIELD Core, keep in mind that you may need to add @M{--trace} to your
  invocation if you want to see the HTTP requests and headers.
