USAGE: @G{shield} rekey [--old-master @Y{PASSWORD}]
                     [--new-master @Y{PASSWORD}]
                     [--rotate-fixed-key]

  Change your SHIELD Master Password.

  SHIELD maintains an internal encrypted vault of secrets,
  for protecting your data archives with strong encryption.
  The keys to this vault are protected by a master password.

@B{Options:}

  --old-master ...    Current master password.
  --new-master ...    New master password.

  --rotate-fixed-key  Rotate the fixed key used for backing
                      up certain jobs (usually SHIELD itself).
                      NOTE: doing so will render previous
                      archives unusable during a disaster
                      recovery scenario; you may want to kick
                      off new runs of those jobs.

  In general, use of the --old-master and --new-master flags
  is discouraged.

  Rekeying should, in general, be an interactive process.
  Not specifying @M{--master} causes shield to prompt you
  for both the current master password, and your desired new
  master password, with appropriate security precautions (no
  terminal echo, confirmation, etc.)
