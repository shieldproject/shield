USAGE: @G{shield} banish --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{USER}

  Banish a local user from a SHIELD Tenant.

  Each SHIELD Core defines one or more tenants, each with their own
  set of cloud storage configurations, data systems, and backup jobs.

  Once banished, a user will be unable to interact with that tenant until
  they are extended another invitation, perhaps under a different role.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command is only available to @R{SHIELD Site Managers},
        and @R{SHIELD Tenant Managers}.

  This command only operates on one (user,tenant) pairing at a time.
  For bulk operations, either avail yourself of the SHIELD API, or run
  the command multiple times.
