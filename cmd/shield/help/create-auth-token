USAGE: @G{shield} create-auth-token

  Issue a new authentication token, for the current user.

  SHIELD users can issue @W{authentication tokens}, which can be
  used in scripts and other automatons to represent the issuing
  account, and all of their privileges within the system.

  This command contacts your currently targeted SHIELD Core, and
  asks it to issue a new token for authentication.
