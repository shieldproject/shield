USAGE: @G{shield} pause-job --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Pause a Backup Job.

  Backup Jobs are the linchpin of SHIELD configuration; they
  provide the what, when, and where, tying together target data
  systems (the "what"), cloud storage ("where"), a schedule, and
  a retention policy into one schedulable unit of data protection.

  Paused backup jobs will not be automatically scheduled by SHIELD.
  In order to execute them, an operator will need to manually kick
  them off, via @C{shield run-job}.
