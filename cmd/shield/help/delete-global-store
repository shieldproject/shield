USAGE: @G{shield} delete-global-store @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Delete a Shared Cloud Storage System

  SHIELD needs a place to store all of the backup archives it is
  going to generate, and Cloud Storage is where it's at.  Each
  Cloud Storage System provides the configuration details needed
  to write to and read from some external storage endpoint, be it
  Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a local WebDav instance.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command can only be used to delete shared storage
  systems, and you must be a site engineer to use it.  If you need to
  delete a storage system that belongs to one of your tenants, please
  see @C{shield delete-store}.

  @Y{ALSO NOTE:} You will only be able to delete @W{unused} storage
  systems; if the system is being referenced by any backup job
  configuration (in any tenant), you will be unable to delete it.
