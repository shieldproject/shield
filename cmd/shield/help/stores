USAGE: @G{shield} stores --tenant @Y{TENANT} [OPTIONS]

  List Cloud Storage Systems

  SHIELD needs a place to store all of the backup archives it is
  going to generate, and Cloud Storage is where it's at.  Each
  Cloud Storage System provides the configuration details needed
  to write to and read from some external storage endpoint, be it
  Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a local WebDav instance.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command can only display storage systems for a single
  SHIELD Tenant.  For shared storage, see @C{shield global-stores}.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all defined cloud storage systems will be displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  --used          Only show storage systems that are either @W{used}
  --unused        (referenced by a job configurtion) or @W{unused}.
                  These options are mutually exclusive.

  --with-plugin   Only show storage systems that are using the given
                  storage plugin.

@B{Examples:}

  # Where are we using Amazon S3?
  @W{shield stores}       \
     @Y{--used}           \
     @Y{--with-plugin} @C{s3}

  # Which storage systems can we decomission?
  @W{shield stores} \
    @Y{--unused}
