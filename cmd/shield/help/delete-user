USAGE: @G{shield} delete-user @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Delete a local SHIELD User.

  SHIELD supports a several 3rd party authentication providers,
  including Github and Cloud Foundry UAA, but for sheer simplicity,
  nothing beats local users.  Local SHIELD users exist inside the
  SHIELD database, and can be assigned tenant- and system-roles
  arbitrarily.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command can only be used by SHIELD site managers.

  Deleting a user will remove all of their authenticated sessions,
  and also remove any auth tokens they may have issued.

  @R{This is a dangerous operation that cannot be undone.}
