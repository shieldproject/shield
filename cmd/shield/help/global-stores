USAGE: @G{shield} global-stores [OPTIONS]

  List Shared Cloud Storage Systems

  SHIELD needs a place to store all of the backup archives it is
  going to generate, and Cloud Storage is where it's at.  Each
  Cloud Storage System provides the configuration details needed
  to write to and read from some external storage endpoint, be it
  Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a local WebDav instance.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command only display shared storage systems, which
  are visible to all SHIELD tenants.  If you only want to see the
  systems defined for your tenant(s), see @C{shield stores}.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all shared cloud storage systems will be displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  --used          Only show storage systems that are either @W{used}
  --unused        (referenced by a job configurtion) or @W{unused}.
                  These options are mutually exclusive.

  --with-plugin   Only show storage systems that are using the given
                  storage plugin.

@B{Examples:}

  # Where are we using Amazon S3?
  @W{shield global-stores}  \
     @Y{--used}             \
     @Y{--with-plugin} @C{s3}

  # Which shared storage systems can we decomission?
