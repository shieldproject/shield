USAGE: @G{shield} targets --tenant @Y{TENANT} [OPTIONS]

  List Target Data Systems.

  SHIELD needs to know what you want it to back up, which is why
  it defines Target Data Systems.  These can be anything from
  "that directory over there" to "all of these databases" -- if
  there exists a target plugin for it, you can back it up.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all defined target data systems will be displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  --used          Only show data systems that are either @W{used}
  --unused        (referenced by a job configurtion) or @W{unused}.
                  These options are mutually exclusive.

  --with-plugin   Only show data systems that are using the given
                  target plugin.

@B{Examples:}

  # What PostgreSQL databases do we have configured?
  @W{shield targets}  \
     @Y{--used}       \
     @Y{--with-plugin} @C{postgres}

  # Which data systems can we decomission?
  @W{shield targets} \
    @Y{--unused}
