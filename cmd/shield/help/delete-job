USAGE: @G{shield} delete-job --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Delete a Backup Job.

  Backup Jobs are the linchpin of SHIELD configuration; they
  provide the what, when, and where, tying together target data
  systems (the "what"), cloud storage ("where"), a schedule, and
  a retention policy into one schedulable unit of data protection.

  @R{This is a dangerous operation that cannot be undone.}
