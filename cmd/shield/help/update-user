  SHIELD itself, giving them the ability to view and modify the
  configuration of the software, authentication, tenancy, etc.

  The following system roles are defined:

    @M{admin}     Complete access to SHIELD, including the ability
              to view and manage registered agents, manage user
              sessions, and more.

    @M{manager}   System Managers are responsible for managing
              local SHIELD users and their access level.

              view task logs, etc.
