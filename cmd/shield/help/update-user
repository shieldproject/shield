USAGE: @G{shield} update-user [OPTIONS] @{NAME-OR-UUID}

  SHIELD supports a several 3rd party authentication providers,
  including Github and Cloud Foundry UAA, but for sheer simplicity,
  nothing beats local users.  Local SHIELD users exist inside the
  SHIELD database, and can be assigned tenant- and system-roles
  arbitrarily.

  Note that it is not possible to change a user's username.

  -n, --name        A new display name for this user.

  -p, --password    Change the users password.

     --system-role  Assign this user a system role.
                    Must be one of @M{engineer}, @M{manager}, or @M{admin}.

@B{System Roles:}

  Assigning a user a System Role grants them special access into
  SHIELD itself, giving them the ability to view and modify the
  configuration of the software, authentication, tenancy, etc.

  The following system roles are defined:

    @M{admin}     Complete access to SHIELD, including the ability
              to view and manage registered agents, manage user
              sessions, and more.

    @M{manager}   System Managers are responsible for the creation
              and management of SHIELD Tenants; they have the
              ability to invite and banish users to / from any
              tenant.  They also manage local SHIELD users.

    @M{engineer}  Full access to everything that is shared between
              tenants, namely cloud storage systems.
