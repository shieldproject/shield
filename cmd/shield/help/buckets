  List Shared Cloud Storage Buckets

  SHIELD needs a place to store all of the backup archives it is
  going to generate, and Cloud Storage is where it's at.  Each
  Cloud Storage Bucket provides the configuration details needed
  to write to and read from some external storage endpoint, be it
  Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a local WebDav instance.
