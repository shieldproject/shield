USAGE: @G{shield} import @Y{FILE}
       @G{shield} import @Y{-} <FILE

  Import configuration into SHIELD, in bulk.

  SHIELD has a lot of configuration, from protected systems,
  to backup schedules, to local users.

  While you could conceivably write a script to automate the
  stand-up of a new SHIELD environment, we've provided a much
  simpler alternative, vis-a-vis a YAML-based import command!


@B{Options:}

  --example      Print out an annotated example import file, and exit.

  Note: the global --core flag comes in handy.

@B{Example:}

  @W{shield import} -c a-new-shield ~/shield/prod.yml

or, if you'd like to fit the import task into a pipeline that generates
the YAML data for you:

  spruce merge ... | @W{shield import} -c a-new-shield -

(The '-' means 'read from standard input')
