USAGE: @G{shield} import @Y{FILE}
       @G{shield} import @Y{-} <FILE

  Import configuration into SHIELD, in bulk.

  SHIELD has a lot of configuration, between storage systems and
  target data systems, users and tenants, etc.  While you could
  conceivably write a script to automate the stand-up of a new
  SHIELD environment, we've provided a much simpler alternative,
  vis-a-vis a YAML-based import command!


@B{Options:}

  --example      Print out an annotated example import file, and exit.

  Note: the global --core flag comes in handy.

@B{Example:}

  @W{shield import} -c a-new-shield ~/shield/prod.yml

or, if you'd like to fit the import task into a pipeline that generates
the YAML data for you:

  spruce merge ... | @W{shield import} -c a-new-shield -

(The '-' means 'read from standard input')
