USAGE: @G{shield} run-job --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Manually Run a Backup Job.

  Backup Jobs are the linchpin of SHIELD configuration; they
  provide the what, when, and where, tying together target data
  systems (the "what"), cloud storage ("where"), a schedule, and
  a retention policy into one schedulable unit of data protection.

  When you run a job via @C{shield run-job}, SHIELD will temporarily
  ignore the schedule and schedule an immediate, ad hoc execution
  of the job, whether or not it was paused
