USAGE: @G{shield} sessions [OPTIONS]

  List Authenticated SHIELD Sessions.

  Whenever users authenticate to SHIELD, whether they do so via
  the snazzy web UI, or via the rock-solid CLI utility, they
  generate an authenticated session in the SHIELD database.  These
  sessions are created for local users as well as 3rd-party users
  who come in by way of authentication providers.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command can only be used by SHIELD site engineers.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all shared cloud storage systems will be displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  -l, --limit     Only show this many sessions, instead of all.
                  Currently, there is no way to paginate the results
                  of this command.  Sad.

  -u, --user      Limit the list of sessions to only those associated
                  with the given user (specified by UUID).  Note that
                  this will also include any sessions authenticated by
                  that users auth tokens (i.e. scripts, pipelines, etc.)

      --ip        Limit the list of sessions to only those originating
                  from a given IP address.

@B{Examples:}

  # Where is jhunt (assuming that's the right UUID) logged in from?
  @W{shield sessions} \
     @Y{--user} @C{0c14cc60-f001-400e-9858-1a5ab888b823}

  # Who is logging in from 10.56.78.9?
  @W{shield sessions} \
    @Y{--ip} @C{10.56.78.9}
