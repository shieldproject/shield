USAGE: @G{shield} target --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Show a single Target Data System.

  SHIELD needs to know what you want it to back up, which is why
  it defines Target Data Systems.  These can be anything from
  "that directory over there" to "all of these databases" -- if
  there exists a target plugin for it, you can back it up.
