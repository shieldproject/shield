USAGE: @G{shield} jobs --tenant @Y{TENANT} [OPTIONS]

  List Backup Jobs.

  Backup Jobs are the linchpin of SHIELD configuration; they
  provide the what, when, and where, tying together target data
  systems (the "what"), cloud storage ("where"), a schedule, and
  a retention policy into one schedulable unit of data protection.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all defined backup jobs will be displayed.
  You may filter the results with the following command-line flags.

  --target        Only show backup jobs for the given target data
                  system (given by name or UUID).

  --store         Only show backup jobs for the given cloud storage
                  system (given by name or UUID).

  --policy        Only show backup jobs for the given retention
                  policy (given by name or UUID).

  --paused        Only show jobs that are not scheduled (@W{paused}),
  --unpaused      or that are (@W{unpaused}).  These two options are
                  mutually exclusive.

@B{Examples:}

  # What Azure-bound jobs aren't running automatically?
  @W{shield jobs}      \
     @Y{--store} Azure \
     @Y{--paused}

  # How are we backing up UAADB?
  @W{shield jobs}       \
     @Y{--target} UAADB
