USAGE: @G{shield} update-policy-template [OPTIONS] @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Update an existing Retention Policy Template

  No backup is good forever.  SHIELD utilizes retention policies
  to automatically expire backup archives that are too old, and
  automatically remove them from cloud storage.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command manages @W{templates} for retention
  policies, which are copied over to new SHIELD Tenants when they
  are first created.  Only SHIELD site engineers can use this
  command; for managing retention policies in your own tenant(s),
  see @C{shield update-policy}.

@B{Options:}

  Updates are entirely specified via command-line arguments.

  -n, --name      A new name for the Retention Policy.

  -s, --summary   An optional, long-form description for the policy.

  -d, --days      How many days to keep backup archives for.
                  This field is @W{required}, and must be a positive,
                  non-zero, whole number.
