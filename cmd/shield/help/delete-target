USAGE: @G{shield} delete-target --tenant @Y{TENANT} @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Delete a Target Data System.

  SHIELD needs to know what you want it to back up, which is why
  it defines Target Data Systems.  These can be anything from
  "that directory over there" to "all of these databases" -- if
  there exists a target plugin for it, you can back it up.

  @Y{NOTE:} You will only be able to delete @W{unused} target data
  systems; if the system is being referenced by any backup job
  configuration, you will be unable to delete it.
