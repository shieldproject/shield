USAGE: @G{shield} policy-template @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Show a single Retention Policy Template

  No backup is good forever.  SHIELD utilizes retention policies
  to automatically expire backup archives that are too old, and
  automatically remove them from cloud storage.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command manages @W{templates} for retention
  policies, which are copied over to new SHIELD Tenants when they
  are first created.  Only SHIELD site engineers can use this
  command; for managing retention policies in your own tenant(s),
  see @C{shield policy}.
