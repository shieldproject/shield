  Annotate a Backup Archive with Notes.

  When SHIELD successfully performs a backup operation, it generates
  a backup archive containing all of the protected data form that
  particular system, at that particular point in time.  This archive
  is then placed in cloud storage, awaiting either expiry and purgation,
  or restoration to a data system.

  As an operator, you can attach helpful little notes, like "this is
  the production backup for change #12345", to archives.

@B{Options:}

  --notes         (required) The notes to attach to this archive.
                  This text will be set in the "notes" field for the
                  archive, replacing whatever was there before.

@B{Examples:}

  # This archive is for tonight's change:
  @W{shield annotate-archive} \
    @Y{ca24f30b-87f6-4599-bf9e-818998c4b0de} \
    @Y{--notes} "Prod backup for change #12345"
