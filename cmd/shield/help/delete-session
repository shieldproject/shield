USAGE: @G{shield} delete-session @Y{UUID}

  Delete a SHIELD Session.

  Whenever users authenticate to SHIELD, whether they do so via
  the snazzy web UI, or via the rock-solid CLI utility, they
  generate an authenticated session in the SHIELD database.  These
  sessions are created for local users as well as 3rd-party users
  who come in by way of authentication providers.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command can only be used by SHIELD site engineers.

  When a session is deleted, any clients using that session are
  forcibly logged out.  CLI users will begin to receive errors about
  not being authenticated;  Web UI users will be redirected to the
  main login page.
