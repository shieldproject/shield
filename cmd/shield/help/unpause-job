  Unpause a Backup Job.

  Backup Jobs are the linchpin of SHIELD configuration; they
  provide the what, when, and where, tying together target data
  systems (the "what"), cloud storage ("where"), a schedule, and
  a retention policy into one schedulable unit of data protection.

  Unpausing a backup job cuases SHIELD to resume scheduling it for
  automatic (and regular) execution.  Any missed time slots will be
  ignored, and the next upcoming scheduled run will be targeted.

  Note that you can still manually execute ad hoc runs of an unpaused
  backup job via @C{shield run-job}.
