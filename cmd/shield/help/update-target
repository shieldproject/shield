USAGE: @G{shield} update-target --tenant @Y{TENANT} [OPTIONS] @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Update an existing Target Data System

  SHIELD needs to know what you want it to back up, which is why
  it defines Target Data Systems.  These can be anything from
  "that directory over there" to "all of these databases" -- if
  there exists a target plugin for it, you can back it up.

@B{Options:}

  Updates are entirely specified via command-line arguments.

  -n, --name        A new name for the Target Data System.

  -s, --summary     An optional, long-form description for the
                    storage system.

  -a, --agent     The address (in ip:port format) of the SHIELD
                  Agent that will be used for running backup and
                  restore operations.

  -p, --plugin      The name of the plugin binary to use.  The chosen
                    plugin must support "target" operations, and must
                    be available on the selected agent.

      --clear-data  Clear the plugin configuration before applying new
                    configuration from @Y{--data ...} flags.  If not
                    specified, existing keys will be left alone, new
                    keys will be added, and overridden keys will be
                    updated.

  -C, --compression
                    The type of compression to use when backing up this
                    target. Valid values are `bzip2' and `none'. Defaults
                    to `bzip2'.

  -d, --data        Configuration data for the target plugin, in the
                    format @Y{--data} @G{key_name}=@C{value}.  Note that you may
                    be required to quote this to avoid tokenization of
                    the provided value by your shell.

                    This field may be specified multiple times, either 
                    to provide new configuration key / values, or to
                    override configuration specified earlier in the
                    command-line invocation.

@B{Examples:}

  # Rename "Important Files" storage to just "Uploads":
  @W{shield update-target} "Important Files" \
      @Y{--name} Uploads

  # Change the credentials for accessing the database
  @W{shield update-target} CCDB   \
      @Y{--data} @G{username}=@C{new-dba} \
      @Y{--data} @G{password}=@C{welcome1}
