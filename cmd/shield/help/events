USAGE: @G{shield} events [--skip @Y{EVENT-or-QUEUE} [--skip ...]]

  Stream SHIELD Core Websocket Events.

@B{Options:}

  By default, all events that are accessible to the authenticated
  session will be displayed.  You may filter the results using the
  "skip" flag:

    --skip EVENT-TYPE    This option can be given more than once.
    --skip QUEUE         Event Types are a fixed set of keywords
                         (listed below).  Queue names are defined
                         internally by SHIELD.

    @C{task-status-update}  A task changed status.
    @C{task-log-update}     New task log output appeared.
