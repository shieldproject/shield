# Enhancements
 - An API endpoint `v1/status/jobs` was added to show the most recent success or failure of a job task.  Intended for a monitoring/alerting application to scrape this information periodically
 - In GUI, under Jobs the status is now color coded
 - Also on the dashboard recently failed jobs will appear in a notification bar at the top
